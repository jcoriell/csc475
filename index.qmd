## Course Description

The design and implementation of artificially intelligent programs.  Topics include game playing, heuristic search, logic, knowledge representation, and reasoning strategies.  Social implications are also discussed. More specifically, approximately 2 weeks covering an overview, history, impact, implications, and potential of AI; approximately 3.5 weeks covering machine learning: perceptrons, multi-layer networks, and deep learning; amd approximately 3.5 weeks discussing classical AI: Game Playing and Search; First Order Logic, and Inference.
